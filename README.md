# fictional scenario: **TUICH**, the social network for videogame lovers (patent pending ðŸ˜‰â€‹)

# At TUICH, gamers can have a public profile where they share their best gameplays, but it has a twist. You can only see other players gameplays by spending ***tuicoins***, a fictional coin that you can earn by uploading new content.

# Gamers start with a given amount of *tuicoins*, and anytime they upload a new video, they get rewarded with some more. Then, they can use them to watch other gamers' content; or spend them in the **shop**, where they can get skins for their favorite games or even discounts in some games.
